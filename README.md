# AniDay 
I built this app for my first personal project in Apple Developer Academy @Binus, called AniDay. AniDay is an app to manage your anime daily anime watchlist so you don't have to always search for what anime was released on that day. This app is inspired by my own experience, where I sometimes forgot what anime is released on a day, so I always search for what is released on the day. 

This app's features:
- Add new anime
- Delete anime
- Anime list sorted by day

Tech Stack used in this project:
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- MVVM Design Pattern
- CoreData
